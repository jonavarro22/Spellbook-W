## Scripts Details
### WinGet Export and Import
These scripts rely on WinGet's ability to export and import app lists via JSON files, I just made .bat files because I forget the commands as I don't use this very often.

### FFmpeg Conversion
The `ffmpegToISO.bat` script automates ISO creation from various media formats.
- **Input:** Any media format supported by FFmpeg
- **Output:** ISO image

### YouTube Download
Scripts utilize **yt-dlp**, a robust tool for downloading YouTube content, including premium videos where applicable.
